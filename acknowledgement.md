I sincerely hope that you enjoy using Daily Vibes. However, Daily Vibes would not be here without the initial financial support from:

I am extremely grateful for your support and for giving me an opportunity to make this.

## Libraries
Daily Vibes includes open-source components:
- [Charts](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts) for displaying dashboards
- [SwiftTheme](https://github.com/jiecao-fm/SwiftTheme) for aid with theming

## Icons
Daily Vibes may use icons from one of the following sources: [icons8.com](https://icons8.com), [feathericons.com](https://feathericons.com/), [pixellove.com](https://www.pixellove.com/) in the app or for inspiration.

Thank you,
