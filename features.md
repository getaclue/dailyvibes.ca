Stressed? Overwhelmed? Not sure where to begin? Donâ€™t worry! Everyone has been there. I have three simple steps to get you started. 

- the first step is wanting to change
- the next step is to be mindful and deliberate 
- the final step is to measure. 

Why? Because you cannot improve what you do not measure.

Have something on your mind? Do not wait! Just mark it down as a brand new to-do task item in Daily Vibes and come back to it later. This way, you know where to return to it when you are less overwhelmed.

Daily Vibes is not just another to-do task item manager. Daily Vibes is much more than that. It is here to help you take control of your day to day activities and track your progress along the way.

What makes Daily Vibes different? Well, for one, in Daily Vibes you cannot un-complete a finished task. Sorry. Cannot do it. You can delete it. You can archive it. But you only get one shot at crossing it off and completing it. Be deliberate about breaking down large tasks into small and achievable items. Cross them off as complete them and move on to the next.

Put it simply, we want you to be specific and deliberate about setting your goals. 

And if all this text if overwhelming, then do not worry. Just download Daily Vibes and give it a shot. Daily Vibes is versatile and has a lot of features. Use it however you want, but be mindful and actually use it! That's all I can ask of you.

In Daily Vibes you can:

- use Tags to group similar items across different projects
- group similar to-do task items by Projects
- set upcoming Due Dates so you do not forget
- organize your Projects or Tags by using the filter and see only what you want to see
- quickly glance at your overall progress using Charts
- view your daily completion rate at all times
- Archive or Delete completed todo item tasks
- using one of the beautiful built in Themes to customize your Appearance (Dark Mode is included out of the box)
- keep an eye on the YEARLY progress
- see something you need to do on Safari? simply Share to Daily Vibes and come back to it later
- and keep an eye out for upcoming features
