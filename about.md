Hello, my name is [Alex Kluew](https://getaclue.me/). I run Daily Vibes all by myself and I sincerely hope that you give it a shot.

## What make Daily Vibes different?
What is different about Daily Vibes, as compared to other similar projects, is my transparency. The application is developed and optimized for iOS. You can really follow along on my journey. Moreover, you, as the user of Daily Vibes, can have direct impact on the development of the application. Simply reach out and find me on one of the [following channels](/support/).

## Developed for iOS
The application was developed using Swift and optimized for iOS. No cross-platform bloat or slowdowns. The third party libraries, if any, were carefully chosen to make the app better for you. I care about your experience and I want you to enjoy using Daily Vibes.

## Initial Project Writeup
The initial project write up, history, and reasoning can be read [here](https://gist.github.com/getaclue/f1a3b6be4bf5a25d931a0b0bc6099885).

I hope that will you enjoy following along on this journey and I encourage you to give the application a shot. A special thanks goes out to my wonderful [Laura](https://lastminutelaura.ca/) for vision, support, and encouragement. Couldn't have done it without you!
